          <p>Hello, I'm Cory. I'm a student at Red River College in their Business Information Technology course, and welcome to my "early 2000s" looking website! </p>
          <p>I've lived in Winnipeg all my life, I went to J.H. Bruns Collegiate, and I mostly spend my time playing video games, hanging out with friends, or learning to use my new longboard.</p>
        </section>

            <img id="longboard-photo" src="images/20211225_110759.jpg" />
            <figcaption class="home-page-caption">My longboard.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This is my longboard. It was a christmas gift from my parents. I've not yet spent time learning to ride it, but I hope to once all the snow goes away!</p>
          <p>A longboard feels like a better fit for me, as I'm not the biggest fan of bikes. Bikes feel too cumbersome, hard to store, and I don't enjoy riding them too much. Longboards/skateboards seem easier to bring around, easier to store (due to being smaller), and I prefer the "aesthetic" of them more.</p>

          <p>Here's my computer! I've had a friend build my computer for me over the years, and its far more enjoyable using this for various tasks and gaming compared to a console.</p>
          <p>The parts in the current build consist of an ASUS RTX 3080, a Ryzen 9 5900X, a 750W power supply, 32GB of RAM, an NVMe, a standard SSD, and 2 HDDs.</p>
